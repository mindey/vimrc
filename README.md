# Vimrc

Vimrc already has all the necessary vim settings that should be by default:

* Netrw configured
* Some ideas was taken from [vim-sensible](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible)
* Persistent undo / history is enabled, and directory was configured to tmp file system
* Tmux integration was added
* Mouse is enabled by default
* Hidden characters like tabs and trailing white spaces will shown by default
* Using ag instead of grep (if ag is installed)

...and more more features

# Installation

I recommend using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), which is my favorite extension for installing vim packages.

How I use the vim-plug along with this extension you can see in this project: [Vim](https://github.com/aliev/vim).

This is a very simple configuration file that will allow you to use your own vimrc (~/.vimrc.local) file without changing anything in base config.

In any other case, the installation of this extension is standard
