# Vimrc

Vimrc already has all the necessary vim settings that should be by default:

* Netrw configured
* Some ideas was taken from [vim-sensible](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible)
* Persistent undo / history is enabled, and directory was configured to tmp file system
* Tmux integration was added
* Mouse is enabled by default
* Hidden characters like tabs and trailing white spaces will shown by default
* Using ag instead of grep (if ag is installed)

...and more more features
